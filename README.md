# Paranoia

Description:
This code uses linked lists to keep track of the players in the game Paranoia. It was written using C.

Paranoia (also known by a variety of other names such as Assassin) is a popular “real-life” game where every player is assigned a unique target that only they know about. They must then “tag” that target in a way agreed upon by the group, e.g., with a nerf gun, taking a flag from them ala flag football. A tagged player is then removed them from the game and the person who tags that player inherits their target.
